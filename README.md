### Getting Started
You can view the slides at https://brianamarie.github.io/10-git-problems/#1. 

To practice each exercise, `cd` into the corresponding directory. Get started with `. script.sh`, and follow the instructions in the `README.md` of that subdirectory or on the slides.

### To-Do
> Note: I'd also like to add a section to each of these on how to _avoid_ these problems in the first place where possible.
