# 10 Git Problems

1. Commit is too big
2. Accidental commit to `master`
3. I'm in a detached head state
4. What broke my code?
5. I want to merge two repositories
6. I want to undo a recursive merge (without GitHub)
7. Forget a binary file
8. How do I remove a submodule?
9. I want to undo a rebase
10. How do I force git pull to overwrite local files?

### Assumptions
- Basic Git knowledge
- Enough to be dangerous

### Things to know

1. This will use `git reset`, so you should first check that:
  - The commits in question are _only local_
  - There are no unintended files in your working or staging directory
2. `git lol` is set for every exercise
3. Most activities start by CD'ing into the directory

---

### Commit is too big

> That commit is too big. It should have been broken up into several commits.

1. Change directories into the activity file: `cd 01-committed-too-big`
2. Run `. setup.sh`
3. Look at the files and the history: `ls` and `git lol`
3. `git reset reset-here` to a certain commit, bringing the changes that should be broken up into the working directory
4. Use `git add -p` to be specific about how commits are formed. You can use `s` to split even further.
5. When you're done with the activity, run `. reset.sh` and `cd ..`

### Accidental Commit

> I committed to master instead of a branch!

1. Change directories into the activity file: `cd 02-accidental-commit-to-master`
2. Run `. setup.sh`
3. Use `git lol` and `git status` to see the current state of your repository
4. Reset back to the last commit that was meant to be on master: `git reset reset-here`
  - Alternatively, you could reset to `origin/master` also
5.  Use `git lol` and `git status` again
6. Create a new branch and checkout to it with `git checkout -b experiment`
  - Notice your working and staging area will come with `HEAD`
7. Stage your changes, and make a commit
8. Once you're finished, run `. reset.sh` and `cd ..`

### I'm in a detached head state

> Git says I'm in a "detached head state" and I don't know what to do.

A detached head state only means that your `HEAD` pointer is currently pointed _not_ to a branch.

To fix this, to get your `HEAD` attached, you need to point to a branch. You can do this by checking out to an existing branch, or creating a new branch where you are.

1. Change directories into the activity file: `cd 03-detached-head`
2. Run `. setup.sh`
3. See where your `HEAD` is pointing with `git lol`
4. Let's create a new branch where we are with `git checkout -b more-work`
  - Now, you're no longer in a detached head state, and can continue working normally on your new branch
5. Reset the activity with `. reset.sh` and `cd ..`

### What broke my code?

> Something's been broken, but I don't know what commit broke it.

There's a test in this directory, checking if any file is empty or not. This only _finds_ the commit introducing the break, it doesn't fix it at all.

1. Change directories into the activity file: `cd 04-what-broke-this`
2. See the test with `ls`, and try it with `. test.sh`
3. To get set up, run the scripts `. setup.sh`
4. Use the test `. test.sh` to find if something's broken
5. Before you can use bisect, you need to be in the root directory of the repository: `cd ..`
6. Try the test again: `. 04-what-broke-this/test.sh`
7. Begin the bisect: `git bisect start`
8. Tell Git where the "broken" commit is: `git bisect bad HEAD`
9. Tell Git where the last known "good" commit was: `git bisect good before-activity4`
10. After Git moves your `HEAD` pointer to a different commit, try your test again: `04-what-broke-this/test.sh`
11. Depending on the results of the test, type `git bisect good` or `git bisect good`
12. Continue until Git finds the commit
13. Exit the bisect: `git bisect reset`
14. Reset the files: `. 04-what-broke-this/reset.sh`

### I want to merge two repositories

> There are two separate project repositories that should be in one repository, but they have unrelated histories.

In practice, you might want to create a new repository to have the combined histories of both of the other repositories. Then, it would be best to archive the singular repositories.

1. Run the setup script: `. setup.sh`
2. Add the other repository as a second remote: `git remote add other-repo https://github.com/brianamarie/another-repository.git` OR `. add-remote.sh`
3. Before you try to merge, make sure you have all of the remote tracking branches for all remotes: `git fetch --all`
4. Try to merge the two repositories: `git merge other-repo/master` and notice the error message.
5. Since these two repositories have unrelated histories, we need to specify a particular type of merge: `git merge other-repo/master --allow-unrelated-histories`
6. You can see the combined history with the alias `git lol`
7. Reset the exercise: `. reset.sh` and `cd ..`

### I want to undo a recursive merge (without GitHub)

> A merge happened locally, and then I pushed. I'd like to revert the merge and maintain all of committed history.

When reverting a merge, Git wants to know about the "parent" commits. The branch you were on when you merged is the parent, so we will refer to it as "1".

1. Run `. setup.sh`
2. Look at the log, and take lineage of commits' parents into account: `git lol`
3. Identify which branch is the "parent" branch of the merge, `md-files` in our case
4. Identify the merge commit
5. Revert the merge commit: `git revert -m <parent> <commit>`
  - ex: `git revert -m 1 cd4370f`
6. Look at the files and the log: `git lol`, and `ls`
7. Reset the activity: `. reset.sh` and `cd ..`

### I need Git to ignore a binary file

> I committed a binary file a long time ago, how to make git forget about a file that was tracked but is now in .gitignore?

When files are defined in the `.gitignore` from the start, Git will always ignore them. But, if a file is already tracked by Git, adding the name to the `.gitignore` doesn't do any good.

1. Run `. setup.sh`, then notice your history and working directory
2. Create a `.gitignore` file in the _root directory_ of this repository
3. Add `test.img` to the `.gitignore` file
4. Add and commit the `.gitignore` file
4. Change directories back into this activity: `cd 07-forget-binary`
4. Change the big binary file `. change-binary.sh`
5. Add and commit the binary file.
  - What did you expect to happen? Git knows the file based on its similarity index, not by the name, so it's still tracked.
6. For Git to ignore a file that is already being tracked, you need to remove the cache: `git rm --cached test.img`

> Note: this does not remove the file from history, only from tracking and any _new_ commits.

### How do I remove a submodule?

> I had needed a submodule in the past, but it's no longer necessary. How do I remove it completely from this repository?

Submodules are sticky business, and if you want out, it takes a few steps.

1. Make sure you're in the root directory of this repository.
2. Add a submodule with the script: `. 08-remove-submodule/setup.sh`
3. Notice there is a submodule with: `cat .gitmodules`
4. Remove the contents of the directory and "de-initialize" the submodule: `git submodule deinit example-submodule`
5. Remove the path that Git uses to keep track of the submodule: `git rm <path_to_submodule>`
6. Commit those changes: `git commit -m "removed submodule"`
6. Remove the reference in the `.git` directory: `rm -rf .git/modules/<path_to_submoule>`
7. Remove the `.gitmodules` directory from the root directory of the repository: `rm -rf .gitmodules`
8. Reset the repository: `. 08-remove-submodule/reset.sh`

???

### I want to undo a rebase

> I rebased onto the wrong branch!

A rebase is done to force a fast-forward merge, and result in a straight line of history. To go back, you usually need to use `git reflog`. It's not intuitive or easy to find the correct commit to reset to.

1. Change directories for this activity: `cd 09-undo-rebase`
2. Run `. setup.sh`
  - This script creates new commits on master and on the `md-files` branch, then rebases the `md-files` branch onto `master`
3. See the history with `git lol`
  - Notice a tag? The script also tagged the commit _before_ the rebase took place.
4. Using the `git reflog`, identify the most recent commit by message, and find the last instance of it in the reflog
5. Use that commit ID or the tag to reset the branch: `git reset --hard before-rebase`
6. See your history, as it was before the reset: `git lol`
7. Reset the activity: `. reset.sh` and `cd ..`

### Can I force pull from the remote?

> I've made changes that seemingly conflict with the upstream changes. I don't want to keep mine, I just want to keep those from the remote! Can I force pull?

While there _is_ a `git push --force` command, there isn't a `git pull --force` command.

1. Change directories for this activity: `cd 10-force-pull`
2. Run `. setup.sh`
3. Make a major change to `10-force-pull/conflicts.md` (do NOT add or commit)
4. Try to pull: what happens?
5. Three options:
  1. Add and commit your changes, then `git pull`
  2. `git stash`, then pull, and then `git pop`
  3. Take the changes on master and overwrite your own: `git reset --hard origin/master`
